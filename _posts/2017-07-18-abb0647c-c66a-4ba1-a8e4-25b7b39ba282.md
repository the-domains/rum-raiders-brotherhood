# Raison\` de Courir

> and why we donate

# We are all about a little bit of exercise and a whole lot of fun! We aren't about racing or being an obstacle warrior. We are about having a good time and meeting friendly people!

We are also really interested in contributing to non-profits in any way we can! Wounded Nature is the non-profit we are partnering with because we believe in what they do!

**Wounded Nature** -- They assemble volunteer boaters, veterans and volunteers to remove debris from hard to reach coastal areas designated by Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of Natural Resources as critical wildlife areas. Their goal is to increase the amount of domestic fish, shrimp and shellfish stocks.
